    "<a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html\">Regular expressions</a> (also called regex, regexes, regex pattern, regexp, or REs) are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are used in programming and text processing to match and manipulate strings of text based on a specific pattern.\n",
    "A regular expression is a pattern used to match one or more text strings. It is usually composed of a combination of characters, symbols, and metacharacters. Metacharacters are special characters that have a specific meaning in regular expressions, for example, the period (.) that matches any single character, or the asterisk (*) that matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
    "Regular expressions can be used to perform a variety of operations on text data, such as searching for specific patterns, replacing text with other text, or extracting specific information from a text string. \n",
    "Some common examples of regular expressions are matching an email addresses, phone numbers, dates, and URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be complex and difficult to read, but they are a powerful tool for manipulating and processing text data. Luckily, there are many resources that can help us write the correct regular expression for our task. Also, Python has built-in mobule (`re`) to use regular expressions.\n",

For example, named entities would be Joe Biden, New York city, and congress. Named entities are usually instances of entity instances. For example, Joe Biden is an instance of a politician/person, New York City is an instance of a place, and congress is as instance of an organization. \n",
