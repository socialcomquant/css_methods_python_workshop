#### Workshop Date
11-12 April 2023

#### Location
Venue: Koç University, Rumelifeneri Campus

#### Target group
Undergraduate, master students, doctoral candidates, and experienced researchers who want to get introduced to the practice of Computational Social Science.

#### Requirement
Participants are expected to know the basics of Python and have at least some experience using it. For the workshops, participants should bring a running system on which they can execute Jupyter Notebooks. We will be using Python 3.9 and several standard libraries that are part of the Anaconda 2022.10 distribution or can be installed on top of that. A list of libraries and versions of these libraries that participants should import will be circulated before the workshops. We recommend that participants install Anaconda 2022.10. Feel free to also work in a cloud like Google Colab. Consult [this link](https://github.com/gesiscss/css_methods_python/blob/main/a_introduction/1_computing_infrastructure.ipynb) for more detailed instructions on how to set up your computing environment.

#### Lecturers
[Dr. N. Gizem Bacaksizlar Turbic](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/staff/person/Gizem.BacaksizlarTurbic) is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Social Science departments at [RWTH Aachen University](https://cssh.rwth-aachen.de/) and [GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science). Her research areas include complex adaptive systems and social and political networks.

[Dr. Arnim Bleier](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/staff/person/arnim.bleier) is a senior researcher in the Computational Social Science department at [GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science). His research interests are in the field of Natural Language Processing and reproducibility. In collaboration with social scientists, he develops Bayesian models for the content, structure and dynamics of social phenomena.

[Dr. Nicolò Gozzi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bxijW04AAAAJ) is a research scientist at [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it/). His research areas include computational/digital epidemiology and network science.

[Dr. Haiko Lietz](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/staff/person/haiko.lietz) is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Social Science department at [GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science). His research interests are in computational sociology, network science, and complexity science.
